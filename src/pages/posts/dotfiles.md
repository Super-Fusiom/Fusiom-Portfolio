# dotfiles

My _dotfiles_ contains everything that I use in a daily basis either in a Laptop or in a desktop

## Contents
1. **Hyprland config**: Includes not only the keybinds and the config of hyprland, but also its ecosystem and programs with them such as hyprpaper, waybar and wofi.

2. **zsh**: Contains the custom zsh files that are executed via .zshenv or .zshrc directly or through sourcing other files. Assumes `ZDOTDIR` is set to `$HOME/.config/zsh`.

3. **nvim**: Has all of the lua files for my custom way of using nvim, using lazy as the package manager for plugins.

There will be more as I go along, most of it is a mess but I will clean it up as much as I can.
